# qmd-ctupres

[quarto](https://quarto.org) revealjs extension for CTU Bern.

THIS IS IN DEVELOPMENT

### Installing the extension

To install, type the following into the terminal and accept to install

```
quarto install extension aghaynes/qmd-ctupres
```

### Using the template

Once installed, you can create a new directory with all necessary files via the following command 

```
quarto use template aghaynes/qmd-ctupres
```

It will ask if you trust the author of the template (hopefully you do...), and then for a directory name. Type the path relative to your current location.
